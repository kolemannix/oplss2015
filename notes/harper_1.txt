WTT ~ Proofs
Category Theory < Cat Logic > Proof Theory

Keep an eye on
1. Abstraction
   "behavioral characterization"
   implementation =/= the abstraction
2. Strictures, not Affordances
   "less is more", (non)-conservative extension
   * expressive power stems from the restrictions the language imposes
   Constructivity ------> Axiomatic Freedom
3. Proof Relevance
   Proofs are mathematical objects
   Not just metatheory, part of the theory

Identity
	"No entity without identity"
	What is equality?
